# On commercialisation

Most existing meshnets work on the principle of "you may use it for free, but if you contribute to the network, others
should be allowed reasonable usage of your contribution for free."

This is also the principle behind the GNU General Public Licence, and it works well for softare licencing, but this requires
an authority to enforce the licence, which is not desireable, or even impossible in a distributed system.

Although noble in intention, such a rule does not incentivise people to make such a contribution. People (and especially companies)
 are selfish in nature. They want as much as possible for as little as possible. Therefore, selfish actors on the network
(probably a majority of users) will be reluctant to let others use their connections, but will be more than willing to exploit
the rest of the network as much as possible.

## Proposal for a scalable incentive to contribute

Any connection between two direct peers is metered, and the owners of the peered equipment negociate what this means
in terms of compensation. This compensation can mean a payment in cash, they may allow anyone to use it for free, etc...

To make things easier, and lower the entrance barrier, GeoMesh-preinstalled equipment could also come with cryptocoin
software preinstalled. This cryptocoin would have to support microtransactions.

Since there will often be many paths to get a packet from A to B, there will be a lot of competition between peers on
different paths, creating a downwards pressure on the price.

To encourage experimentation and joining the network, one could also propose to allow someone to, say, upload or download
the first 10 GiB for free.

## How does this compare to traditional ISPs?

Due to the decentralised nature of the network, the barrier of entry for new peers is very low, and this will create
much stronger competition then when only a few large ISPs compete with eachother (if there is even more than 1).

## I have an unlimited connection at home, why shoud I pay for GeoMesh?

If your home connection is really unlimited, you have got a very good deal indeed. But start downloading at full speed
24/7, and you'll quickly notice just how unlimited your connection is: not at all. Also, do your neighbours have a bad
connection? Your ISP probably doesn't allow you to resell them yours.

On GeoMesh, you pay for wat you use, but you also don't pay for what you don't use, with noone telling you what you are
or are not allowed to do with it. People will **want** you to use more, as it means more money for them.
If someone does tell you wat you are or are not allowed to do, just find a better peer. Due to the competition on the network,
prices will be low. Your neighbour offering a cheaper connection than your local ISP? Time to switch.

## Can I access services hosted on ICANN-Internet (Facebook, Gmail, Youtube...)?

Yes, you just have to find a gateway node, and tunnel your regular ICANN-Internet traffic through them. Those will be
competing among eachother as well, just like regular GeoMesh nodes, so prices will be competitive.
